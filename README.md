# Hi, I'm Will ðŸ‘‹

### I'm currently working on:
* Running through [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) in my repo [Rusts By Example](https://github.com/flintyglomgold/rusts_by_example)
* * This is more of a diary of exercises completed than any kind of additional information or contextualization.

### I'm currently studying:
* The very basics of [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
* * Also practing my pixel art
* Examples and walkthroughs on [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com)

### In the past I was trained in:
* Application security testing - mostly static analysis using [Fortify](https://github.com/fortify)
* Rapid prototyping! So between the two, that's reading bad code and writing bad code! Barrels of fun.

### When I'm not writing code, I'm
* Practicing [blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* Making short films
